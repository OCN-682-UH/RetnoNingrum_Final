# Final Project OCN 682
### Author: Retno Kusuma Ningrum

Welcome to the repository for my Final Project in OCN 682. This project utilizes data from my previous work with WWF Indonesia, specifically from the Leatherback Turtle Conservation Project on Buru Island, Indonesia.

## Purpose  
The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive webpage that narrates the story of the Leatherback Turtle Conservation Project. It will cover everything from the preliminary study to the current impacts and updates.

## Benefit  
The final webpage will serve as a resource that can be shared with government agencies, donors, and other stakeholders interested in the Leatherback Turtle Conservation Project on Buru Island.
Using R as the platform to build this page streamlines the process of updating the story, as new data can be easily incorporated and reprocessed to refresh the content.
