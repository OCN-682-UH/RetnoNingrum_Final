Buru Island, Maluku, Indonesia was chosen as the area of interest due to the information about the existence of turtles and the utilization of turtles in this region. Therefore, the WWF Indonesia team conducted preliminary studies in 2016 by interviewing 12 key informants who were local community members and customary leaders. The purpose of the preliminary survey was to understand the situation and condition of the area of interest, as well as to approach the local community.

The key informant survey revealed that leatherback turtles and hawksbill turtles are the turtle species most commonly encountered. The majority of important informants saw turtles when driving to fishing spots, during fishing activities, and when turtles were nesting on beaches. Some key informants also stated that there are ongoing activities relating to the use of turtles and turtle eggs. WWF Indonesia became aware of the situation and performed rigorous monitoring in the area of concern, which was suspected of being a nesting hotspot, throughout 2017. The goal of this activity was to establish the level of turtle and/or turtle egg hunting, as well as the number of nesting activities, specifically for leatherback turtles.

The 2017 monitoring activities identified coastal areas with significant leatherback turtle nesting activity, referred to as **Nesting Hotspots**. These hotspots were located in three villages: Waenibe, Wamlana, and Waspait. Leatherback turtles on this beach nest consistently throughout the year, with peak nesting activity occurring in July and February. Given Indonesia's seasonal patterns, it is suggested that the number of nesting events may vary with the seasons. The dry season typically spans from April to October, while the rainy season lasts from November to March.

In 2017, a significant number of leatherback turtle nests were lost due to illegal harvesting, particularly during the initial months of monitoring when awareness about the protected status of leatherback turtles and their eggs was low. Over time, the number of lost nests gradually declined, likely due to increased community awareness of beach patrol activities. These patrols frequently issued warnings and educated locals about the importance of protecting nesting turtles and their eggs. The positive impact of reduced nest loss has reinforced the need for continued monitoring efforts, which aim to boost hatchling production in the nesting areas of the Fena Leisela sub-district. Alongside these efforts, data collection on nest ecology has been conducted to better understand the nesting characteristics of leatherback turtles on Buru Island.

The number of leatherback turtles nesting on Fena Leisela Nesting Beach fluctuates greatly between 2017 and 2023. Leatherback turtle nesting activities peaked in 2020 and 2023. While 2019 was the year with the fewest instances of leatherback turtle nesting activity. This could be related to the leatherback turtle's migration behavior, which may takes over two years.

The nesting patterns of leatherback turtles varied between the dry and rainy seasons. Nesting and non-nesting activities throughout the dry season increased from 2017 to 2023. However, a distinct tendency emerges during the wet season, characterized by a decline in nests and an increase in false crawls. This occurrence appears to be influenced by the wet season, which may disrupt nesting activities. Notably, the rainy season produces larger waves, resulting in reduced beach width and an increased likelihood of inundation, which creates unfavorable nesting conditions for leatherback turtles. The rising incidence of false crawls may indicate that leatherback turtles are reacting to suboptimal nesting sites by ceasing their nesting activities.

In term of the nests condition (whether it is safe, unlawfully taken, or predated), the safe nests were substantially increased since 2017 to date. This occurs as a result of the rigorous and continuous monitoring program. The local enumerator monitored the beach twice daily, nearly every day, from 2017 to 2023. They not only safeguarded the beach, but the presence of the local enumerator also heightened community knowledge regarding the protection of leatherback turtle nests and the preservation of their nesting process.
